          Hello! I'm a passionate developer creating modern and responsive web applications.
          This is a placeholder section where I can talk about my skills, experience,
          and interests. I enjoy working with React, Tailwind CSS, and other
          cutting-edge technologies to build beautiful and functional user interfaces.
